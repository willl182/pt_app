# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the application and the `ptcalc` package, mapping Spanish interface terms to their English equivalents and mathematical symbols where applicable.

| Spanish Term | English Term | Symbol | Definition |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Analito** | Pollutant / Analyte | - | The specific gas or substance being analyzed (e.g., CO, SO2, NO2). |
| **Nivel** | Level | - | The concentration level of the proficiency test item (e.g., low, medium, high). |
| **Puntaje** | Score | $z, z', \zeta, E_n$ | A standardized metric used to evaluate participant performance. |
| **Valor asignado** | Assigned value | $x_{pt}$ | The reference value used for calculating performance scores. Can be derived from formulation, reference lab, or consensus. |
| **Desviación estándar para la evaluación de la aptitud** | Standard deviation for proficiency assessment | $\sigma_{pt}$ | The standard deviation used to calculate z-scores, determining the stringency of the evaluation. |
| **Incertidumbre** | Uncertainty | $u(x)$ | A parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values. |
| **Homogeneidad** | Homogeneity | - | The degree to which the property of a reference material is uniform across units. |
| **Estabilidad** | Stability | - | The degree to which the property of a reference material remains constant over time. |
| **Varianza entre muestras** | Between-sample variance | $s_{s}^2$ | Variance component attributed to differences between proficiency test items. |
| **Varianza dentro de las muestras** | Within-sample variance | $s_{w}^2$ | Variance component attributed to measurement repeatability (replicates). |
| **Valor atípico** | Outlier | - | An observation that appears to deviate markedly from other members of the sample. |
| **Consenso** | Consensus | - | A method of determining the assigned value based on the results of participants (e.g., Algorithm A, Median). |
| **Laboratorio de referencia** | Reference laboratory | - | A laboratory with high metrological standing used to determine the assigned value. |
| **Algoritmo A** | Algorithm A | - | A robust statistical method (ISO 13528) for estimating the mean and standard deviation of data with outliers. |
| **Media robusta** | Robust mean | $x^*$ | The mean calculated using robust statistics to minimize the influence of outliers. |
| **Desviación estándar robusta** | Robust standard deviation | $s^*$ | The standard deviation calculated using robust statistics. |
