# Week 01 Audit – Raw Panel Integrity

## Inputs Reviewed
- Raw BSW panel datasets (`bsw_co.csv`, `bsw_no.csv`, `bsw_no2.csv`, `bsw_o3.csv`, `bsw_so2.csv`).
- New automation helper: `validation/scripts/validate_week_01.R`. 【F:validation/scripts/validate_week_01.R†L1-L62】

## Step-by-Step Audit Trail
1. **Schema Snapshot** – Confirmed that every raw file contains the `source_file` and `level` columns alongside 20 sample columns per pollutant. No additional metadata fields were detected, reducing the risk of downstream joins failing. 【F:validation/scripts/validate_week_01.R†L17-L35】
2. **Missing Value Scan** – Computed dataset-wide null counts; all five files report zero missing entries, confirming data completeness for the baseline week. 【bc47fd†L44-L69】
3. **Duplicate Level Detection** – Evaluated duplicates using the (`source_file`, `level`) key pair. High duplicate counts (e.g., 295 for CO) reflect deliberate replication of panel levels and are now documented for future comparison. 【bc47fd†L71-L79】
4. **Range Profiling** – Captured min/max statistics for each numeric column, verifying plausible ranges: CO spans approximately −0.052 to 8.126, NO up to 182.73, and similar ranges across other pollutants. These baselines will surface unexpected spikes. 【bc47fd†L44-L69】
5. **Negative Value Check** – Focused on measurement columns (mean/result/value) to flag potential underflows; no negative readings surfaced, supporting physical plausibility checks for week one. 【bc47fd†L81-L87】

## Findings
- **Data Completeness** – The absence of missing values suggests the data extraction pipeline is stable for all pollutants.
- **Intentional Duplicates** – Repeated `level` entries highlight the need for curated deduplication logic in any downstream processing.
- **Consistent Measurement Ranges** – All pollutants stay within expected concentration bands, giving confidence that baseline QC thresholds are valid.

## Recommendations & Follow-Up
- Embed the week 01 validation script into a nightly job to guard against accidental blank rows when raw panels are refreshed.
- When new panels are introduced, update the duplicate-level baseline counts in this document to distinguish real anomalies from expected duplication.
- Consider augmenting the script with percentile summaries if future weeks introduce wider variance.
