# Week 02 Audit – Summary Table Consistency

## Inputs Reviewed
- Summary datasets (`summary_n4.csv`, `summary_n7.csv`, `summary_n10.csv`, `summary_n13.csv`).
- Automation helper: `validation/scripts/validate_week_02.R`. 【F:validation/scripts/validate_week_02.R†L1-L61】

## Step-by-Step Audit Trail
1. **Participant Cardinality Check** – Verified that each summary table exposes the expected number of participants (4/7/10/13). No deviations detected, indicating the upstream aggregation respects PT cohort sizes. 【5f85ae†L24-L40】
2. **Sample Group Coverage** – Confirmed the presence of all three sample groups (`1-10`, `11-20`, `21-30`) for every dataset, ensuring the data feed supports subgroup analysis. 【5f85ae†L24-L40】
3. **Pollutant & Level Enumeration** – Inspected pollutant and level catalogs; all tables cover five pollutants with 24 level labels, demonstrating schema alignment across n-scenarios. 【5f85ae†L24-L40】
4. **Replicate Distribution** – Documented replicate identifiers, highlighting how additional labs introduce higher replicate counts (up to 13 for `summary_n13.csv`). This provides a baseline for detecting truncated experiments. 【5f85ae†L24-L40】
5. **Descriptive Statistics** – Calculated min/max/mean for `mean_value` (≈ −0.04 to 182.45) and `sd_value` (max ≈ 2.14). Values remain consistent across n-levels, signalling that aggregation does not distort magnitude. 【5f85ae†L24-L40】

## Findings
- **Cohort Alignment** – The participant counts faithfully mirror the n-designation in each file.
- **Stable Sample Groups** – No missing sample groups were encountered; downstream UI components can rely on the same factor levels.
- **Consistent Variability** – Standard deviations remain below 2.14 across all scenarios, supporting the assumption of controlled variability.

## Recommendations & Follow-Up
- Extend the script with percentile comparisons when future rounds add new pollutants or levels.
- Track the replicate distribution to ensure additional labs append (rather than overwrite) existing entries.
- Pair this audit with week 03 checks to confirm summary behaviour still aligns with advanced calculation inputs.
