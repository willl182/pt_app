The implementation of the interface for test\_homog.md using R Shiny should follow the basic architecture of a Shiny application, separating the User Interface (UI) definition from the server logic. The goal is to allow the user to upload data, select analysis parameters (such as the target level and the proficiency testing standard deviation ), and run the homogeneity and stability assessment functions, whose procedures are based on analysis of variance (aov()) and the comparison of results  and , respectively.

Below is a detailed design, assuming a single file structure (app.R) for a demonstrative example, although for a large application it is recommended to separate it into ui.R and server.R.

### **I. User Interface (UI)**

The UI will be built using a fluid layout (fluidPage) with a sidebar layout (sidebarLayout) to clearly separate the controls (inputs) from the results (outputs). The use of tab panels (tabsetPanel) is recommended to organize the different sections of the analysis: Data, Homogeneity, and Stability.

**UI Structure (ui.R or within fluidPage)**

library(shiny)  
library(DT) \# For interactive tables (optional, but recommended)

ui \<- fluidPage(  
  \# 1\. Application Title  
  titlePanel("Homogeneity and Stability Assessment (PT Items)"),

  \# 2\. Main Layout: Sidebar  
  sidebarLayout(

    \# 2.1. Input Panel (Sidebar)  
    sidebarPanel(

      h3("Upload and Parameters"),

      \# Input 1: File Upload (assuming CSV format as in the source example)  
      fileInput("datafile", "1. Upload PT Data (CSV/TSV)",  
                accept \= c(".csv", ".tsv", ".txt")),

      \# Dynamic UI to select the level (e.g., "Level 1" or "target\_level")  
      \# This is generated on the server once the data is loaded.  
      uiOutput("level\_selector"),

      \# Input 3: Proficiency Testing Standard Deviation (sigma\_pt)  
      numericInput("sigma\_pt", "3. Proficiency Testing Standard Deviation (σ\_pt)",  
                   value \= 0.01, min \= 0, step \= 0.001),

      \# Button to run the analysis  
      actionButton("run\_analysis", "4. Run Analysis",  
                   class \= "btn-success"),

      hr() \# Horizontal line to separate sections  
    ),

    \# 2.2. Main Panel for Results  
    mainPanel(

      \# Outputs organized in tabs (Tabset)  
      tabsetPanel(  
        id \= "analysis\_tabs",

        \# Tab 1: Data Preview  
        tabPanel("Data and Validation",  
                 h4("Preview of Uploaded File"),  
                 tableOutput("raw\_data\_preview"),  
                 h4("Data Validation"),  
                 textOutput("validation\_message")  
        ),

        \# Tab 2: Homogeneity Assessment  
        tabPanel("Homogeneity (ANOVA)",  
                 h4("Homogeneity Criteria ($s\_s^2$ vs $\\\\sigma\_{pt}^2$)"),  
                 textOutput("homog\_conclusion"),  
                 hr(),  
                 h4("Detailed Results"),  
                 verbatimTextOutput("aov\_summary"),  
                 tableOutput("variance\_components")  
        ),

        \# Tab 3: Stability Assessment  
        tabPanel("Stability (y₁ vs y₂)",  
                 h4("Comparison of Initial and Final Measurements"),  
                 textOutput("stability\_conclusion"),  
                 hr(),  
                 h4("Stability Visualization"),  
                 plotOutput("stability\_plot")  
        )  
      )  
    )  
  )  
)

### **II. Server Logic (Server)**

The server function will handle reactivity. Complex calculations (like aov()) will be encapsulated in reactive expressions or eventReactive so they only run when dependencies are met (e.g., when the "Run Analysis" button is pressed).

**Server Structure (server.R or within shinyApp)**

server \<- function(input, output, session) {

  \# R1: Initial Data Loading and Processing  
  raw\_data \<- reactive({  
    \# Requires a file to be uploaded  
    req(input$datafile)

    \# Try to read the file  
    \# We use vroom::vroom for fast reading and delimiter handling  
    ext \<- tools::file\_ext(input$datafile$name)  
    data \<- switch(ext,  
      csv \= vroom::vroom(input$datafile$datapath, delim \= ","),  
      tsv \= vroom::vroom(input$datafile$datapath, delim \= "\\t"),  
      txt \= vroom::vroom(input$datafile$datapath, delim \= ","),  
      \# If the file is invalid, use validate to show a clean error message  
      validate("Invalid file; Please upload a .csv, .tsv, or .txt file")  
    )  
    return(data)  
  })

  \# R2: Dynamic Generation of the Level Selector  
  output$level\_selector \<- renderUI({  
    \# Requires data to be loaded

      levels \<- unique(data$level)  
      selectInput("target\_level", "2. Select PT Level", choices \= levels, selected \= levels)  
    } else {  
      \# Message if the level column is not found  
      p("Warning: 'level' column not found for selection.")  
    }  
  })

      dplyr::mutate(replicate \= dplyr::row\_number()) %\>%  
      tidyr::pivot\_longer(  
        cols \= \-replicate,  
        names\_to \= "Item",  
        values\_to \= "Result",  
        names\_prefix \= "sample\_"  
      )

    \# 3\. ANOVA Calculation  
    \# The procedure uses the aov() function from base R  
    aov\_model \<- aov(Result \~ factor(Item), data \= hom\_data\_filtered)

    \# 4\. Extraction of variances (ss and sw)  
    \# (The specific calculation of ss and sw from the aov() model should be implemented here  
    \# if not trivial, based on Sums of Squares)  
    \# As a placeholder for the output:

    ss \<- 0.0005 \# Placeholder: standard deviation between samples

    \# 5\. Conclusion  
    sigma\_sq\_pt \<- sigma\_pt^2

    if (ss^2 \< sigma\_sq\_pt) {  
      conclusion \<- "Conclusion: The PT items are sufficiently homogeneous."  
    } else {  
      conclusion \<- "Conclusion: WARNING: The PT items are NOT sufficiently homogeneous. The between-sample SD (ss) will be included in the performance evaluation."  
    }

    list(  
      summary \= anova\_summary,  
      ss \= ss,  
      sw \= sw,

### **III. Applied Design Concepts**

* **Controlled Reactivity:** eventReactive(input$run\_analysis, {...}) is used to wrap the homogeneity and stability calculations (homogeneity\_run, stability\_run). This ensures that intensive functions (like aov()) only run after the user has uploaded data, adjusted parameters, and pressed the "Run Analysis" button, rather than recalculating automatically with every small change in an unrelated input.  
* **Input Handling:** fileInput() is used for data loading, and numericInput() for key parameters like . The level selection (target\_level) is handled with uiOutput() and renderUI() on the server, allowing the options to be based dynamically on the uploaded data.  
* **Visualization and Presentation:**  
  * Detailed results and model summaries (like the output of aov()) are presented using verbatimTextOutput() and renderPrint(), which mimic the R console output.  
  * The analysis conclusions (whether it's homogeneous/stable) are displayed in textOutput().  
  * For the stability assessment, a plotOutput() is included that uses ggplot2 to generate a clear visualization of the  vs  comparison.  
* **Validation:** Using req(input$datafile) within the data loading reactive expression (raw\_data) prevents the server from trying to process or display outputs before the file exists, which is essential to prevent errors. Additionally, validate() is used within the loading logic to handle unsupported file types.  
* **Styling:** The design uses the default Bootstrap aesthetic (implicit in fluidPage and sidebarLayout), which provides a professional and responsive appearance on different screen sizes. It is possible to customize the style further using packages like shinythemes or by implementing custom CSS.
