\title{Calculate stability statistics}
\usage{
calculate_stability_stats(
  stab_sample_data,
  hom_general_mean_homog,
  hom_stab_x_pt,
  hom_stab_sigma_pt
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stab_sample_data}{Data frame or matrix with stability samples}

\item{hom_general_mean_homog}{General mean from homogeneity study}

\item{hom_stab_x_pt}{Median of 1st replicate values from HOMOGENEITY study (assigned value x_pt), used as REFERENCE for median_of_diffs calculation}

\item{hom_stab_sigma_pt}{Standard deviation for proficiency assessment from HOMOGENEITY study (robust sigma estimate MADe)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item g: Number of stability samples (groups)
\item m: Number of replicates per stability sample
\item general_mean: Overall mean of ALL stability values
\item sample_means: Vector of stability sample means
\item x_pt: Median of first replicate values (calculated internally, same formula as homogeneity)
\item s_x_bar_sq: Variance of stability sample means
\item s_xt: Standard deviation of stability sample means
\item sw: Within-sample standard deviation (stability)
\item sw_sq: Within-sample variance (stability)
\item ss_sq: Between-sample variance component (stability)
\item ss: Between-sample standard deviation (stability)
\item hom_stab_median_of_diffs: Median of absolute differences between 2nd replicate values (stability) and HOMOGENEITY's x_pt
\item hom_stab_sigma_pt: Standard deviation from HOMOGENEITY study (passed through, not calculated internally)
\item diff_hom_stab: Absolute difference |stability_mean - homogeneity_mean|
\item error: Error message or NULL if successful
}
}
\description{
Calculates statistics from stability data using same pattern as homogeneity
assessment. Independent of homogeneity calculations. Compares stability mean to
homogeneity mean to assess short-term stability of proficiency test items.
