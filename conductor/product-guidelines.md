# Product Guidelines

## 1. Documentation Style
- **Formal and Precise:** Technical documentation must maintain an objective, academic tone, ensuring all statistical definitions are rigorous and aligned with ISO standards.
- **Clear and Instructional:** User guides should use the active voice and provide direct, step-by-step instructions for operating the application and interpreting results.
- **Spanish Primary:** All internal documentation, code comments, and user-facing instructions will be authored in Spanish to ensure clarity for the primary user base.

## 2. User Interface and Visual Identity
- **Professional & Clean Aesthetic:** The Shiny interface will prioritize a minimalist layout with a subdued, professional color palette (blues and greys).
- **Subdued Styling:** Avoid excessive animations or distracting visual elements; the focus must remain on data clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Consistent Layout:** Use a standardized structure for all analysis modules to minimize the user's cognitive load.

## 3. Communication of Results
- **Immediate Visual Feedback:** Critical conclusions (e.g., passing/failing homogeneity) must be conveyed through color-coded alert boxes for instant recognition.
- **Transparency:** While providing summaries, the interface must allow users to drill down into the underlying statistical tables to verify calculations.

## 4. Language and Localization
- **Spanish Interface:** The application’s user interface, including buttons, labels, and instructional text, will be in Spanish.
- **Localized Reporting:** Reports generated by the application will be tailored for a Spanish-speaking audience by default.

## 5. Privacy and Security
- **Anonymization by Default:** To protect participant confidentiality, all visualizations (histograms, score plots, run charts) must use anonymous laboratory identifiers (e.g., "Lab 1", "Lab 2") instead of real names.
- **Local Data Processing:** The application is designed to be executed locally, ensuring that sensitive participant data remains within the organization's secure environment.
