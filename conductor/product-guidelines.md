# Product Guidelines

## 1. Prose Style
*   **Professional and Technical:** The language used throughout the application interface and documentation should be formal, precise, and appropriate for a scientific audience. Terminology must align with ISO 13528:2022 and standard statistical practices.
*   **Clear and Objective:** Descriptions of methods and results should be free of ambiguity.

## 2. Visual Identity
*   **Clean and Minimalist:** The design should prioritize the presentation of data. Unnecessary decorative elements should be avoided to keep the focus on charts, tables, and statistical outputs.
*   **Standard Shiny Aesthetics:** Utilize standard Shiny themes (e.g., Bootstrap) to ensure a familiar and consistent user experience. This promotes intuitive navigation and interaction for users accustomed to R/Shiny applications.

## 3. User Feedback & Tone
*   **Objective and Informative:** Error messages and feedback should be neutral and factual, stating clearly what the issue is without unnecessary polite padding or blame.
    *   *Example:* "Input value is out of range." (Preferred) vs. "Oops! You made a mistake." (Avoid)
*   **Standard-Compliant:** Where applicable, referencing specific ISO clauses in validation messages can add authority and clarity for the target user base.
