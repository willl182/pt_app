# **Product Guidelines**

This document consolidates the style, design, and privacy guidelines for product development, ensuring technical consistency and alignment with industry standards.

## **1\. Prose Style and Documentation**

* **Primary Language (Spanish):** All internal documentation, code comments, and user-facing instructions must be written in Spanish to ensure clarity for our primary user base.  
* **Professional and Technical Tone:** The language used in the interface and documentation must be formal, precise, and suitable for a scientific audience.  
  * *Standard:* Terminology must align strictly with **ISO 13528:2022** and standard statistical practices.  
* **Instructional Clarity:** User guides should use the active voice and provide direct, step-by-step instructions.  
  * *Objective:* Descriptions of methods and results must be free of ambiguity.

## **2\. Visual Identity and User Interface (UI)**

* **Clean and Minimalist Aesthetic:** The interface (built in Shiny) will prioritize data presentation over decorative elements.  
  * *Color Palette:* Use a professional and subdued palette, dominated by blues and greys.  
  * *Style:* Avoid excessive animations; the focus must remain on data clarity and ease of navigation.  
* **Shiny Standards:** Use standard Shiny themes (e.g., Bootstrap) to ensure a familiar and consistent user experience.  
* **Consistent Layout:** Maintain a standardized structure across all analysis modules to minimize the user's cognitive load.

## **3\. Communication of Results and User Feedback**

* **Immediate Visual Feedback:** Critical conclusions (e.g., passing/failing homogeneity tests) must be conveyed through color-coded alert boxes for instant recognition.  
* **Objective and Informative Tone:** Error messages and feedback must be neutral and factual, clearly stating the issue without unnecessary polite "padding" or blaming the user.  
  * *Preferred:* "Input value is out of range."  
  * *Avoid:* "Oops\! You made a mistake."  
* **Transparency:** While providing executive summaries, the interface must allow users to "drill down" into the underlying statistical tables to verify calculations.  
* **Normative Validation:** Where applicable, reference specific ISO clauses in validation messages to add authority and clarity.

## **4\. Localization**

* **Spanish Interface:** All interface elements (buttons, labels, instructional text) will be in Spanish.  
* **Localized Reporting:** Reports generated by the application will be tailored for a Spanish-speaking audience by default.

## **5\. Privacy and Security**

* **Anonymization by Default:** To protect participant confidentiality, all visualizations (histograms, score plots, control charts) must use anonymous laboratory identifiers (e.g., "Lab 1", "Lab 2") instead of real names.  
* **Local Data Processing:** The application is designed to be executed locally, ensuring that sensitive participant data remains within the organization's secure environment.
